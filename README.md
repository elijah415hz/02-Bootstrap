# 02-Bootstrap

## My first portfolio

![portfolio preview](images/portfolio_preview.png)

This site is my first foray into Bootstrap. I used the navbar example from [www.getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to build my navbar. Bootstrap does not have a prebuilt sticky footer, but they have an [example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/sticky-footer/). I copied the html and css and then modified from there.

The content on every page is built using the Bootstrap grid system, and is set to fill the width of the screen on smaller screen sizes using breakpoints.

This site is deployed at [https://elijah415hz.github.io/02-Bootstrap/index.html](https://elijah415hz.github.io/02-Bootstrap/index.html)

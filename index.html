                        I am a freelance classical singer turned web developer. I hold a masters degree in vocal performance from New England Conservatory and have spent the last 5 years working as a full time performer. I was born and raised in Seattle, where I now live, but have been living and working in Boston and later New York for the last 8 years. I was lucky enough to fall in love with Seattle girl (in Colorado, but that's another story), so after riding out the peak of the pandemic in New York we moved home to Seattle with our now 10 month old son. 
                    </p><p>
                        For the last few years I've been considering eventually pivoting to working in software development in order to allow me to settle down a bit more. Being successful in the singing business generally means being on the road a lot. Following the loss of all of my gigs due the pandemic, I've chosen to accelerate the timeline of that. So far it's been an incredibly fun challenge to work a different part of my brain that has gotten only occasional use for the last ten years or so. I'm hopeful that I can combine these new skills with the collaborative skills I've honed as a musician to be a unique and effective web developer.

                        I suppose I didn't explain this yet, but my specific corner of expertise is small ensemble choral music. In the 6 years since I graduated from graduate school I have worked my way to the top of this field. In order to be a successful ensemble singer I have to of course have strong musical and technical singing skills (strong to the level of being able to sight read whatever is put in front of me), but more importantly I have to be able to work within a highly cohesive team that I may have never worked with before. In the moment I have to match the color, volume, and musical style of my colleagues, while silmultaneously contributing my own interpretation of the music. I have to interpret from the written music and from the current situation in the room whether I'm following or leading, or a little of both. All in real time. With people I just met 10 minutes ago. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to be able to incorporate those skills as I learn the workflow of a web development team.
